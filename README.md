## Abstract

Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a set of standards that defines the API
and shell interface for Unix operating systems, enabling developers to write portable and
compatible software that can run on different POSIX-compliant systems without modification.
However, the current POSIX revision is in 2017 which is susceptible of being obsolete. We have
chosen and compared POSIX-compliant and POSIX-certified command shells, libraries and
operating systems which are: ksh88, bash, ncurses, Windows, macOS X, Linux and malloc-
stdlib.h. Overall, we report two limitation case of POSIX which are the lack of modern shellbehaviors in ksh88 and POSIX scope not include graphics user interface making the best offer
for visual usability is only ncurses as terminal user interface. Lastly, we point out two
improvement policies for POSIX or near future operating system standard which are replacing
manual memory allocation via malloc with programming languages that are memory-safe and
banishing POSIX certification fee to encourage contributions.
